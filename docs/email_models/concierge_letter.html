Beach House Rentals!

Dear Guest,

On behalf of the entire Beach House Rentals team, we look forward to ensuring that your visit with us creates special memories for you to take with you.

At Beach House Rentals, our priority is service. We understand you may have questions leading up to your trip and I am here to assist! Should you have any questions regarding your vacation rental accommodations, the Santa Cruz area, local activity ideas, or anything else, please do not hesitate in contacting me directly at Ext. 102.  

The week of your reservation, check your email as I will be sending out a Welcome Letter, which shares all the details regarding checking into your property.

If you have any questions regarding reservation payments, please contact Louise at Ext. 103.

We look forward to serving you in the very near future!
Best wishes and safe travels as you prepare for a relaxing and enjoyable vacation.
